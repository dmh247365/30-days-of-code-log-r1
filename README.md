**1. Code Challenge:**
   CodeWars: 7kyu sum of odd numbers - completed


**2. Course: "The complete react developer in 2021"**
  - Going through the lifecycle of a component, which consists of three main phases:-
    - Mounting: done first
    - Updating: we can put in `shouldComponentUpdate()` with a ternary operator, so as to render or not. 
    - Unmounting: when done, component is forgotten about by DOM.

**1. Code Challenge:**
   CodeWars: 7kyu Vaporcode - completed


**2. Course: "The complete react developer in 2021"**
  - Covering the basics of React, using create react app, pulling simple data from 3rd party api and hosting with github pages.
  - Drilled in that we need to always consider the following three items 
    - Decide on Components
    - Decide the State and where it lives
    - What changes when state changes 


**3. Book: "The Checklist Manifesto"**
   - Read: Intro & chapter1 - 
     - Key takeout(s):
     - 'one needs to practice to achieve mastery, a body of experience before one achieves real success."
     - However that alone is not the answer as mistakes are still made by even the most well trained and intentioned individuals.
