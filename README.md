## 6 - Redux ##
### Day 6: March 13, 2021 - Saturday

|  Code Challenge | Exam Prep: JSNAD | Exam Prep: JSNSD | Course: React dev | Course: Adv React | Read: Checklist Manifesto  | Read: Make it Stick |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------  
| 5/30 | 0/30 | 0/30 | 6/30 | N/A | 6/30 | N/A |

                -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Code Challenge:**
   CodeWars: None done today, spent time on going deep into Redux

                -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


**2. Course: "The complete react developer in 2021"**

- Took a step away and went a bit deeper into Redux. Create a small none React use of Redux together with a detailed readme.
  
described the Redux cycle below in a detailed and easy to understand way (see Redux-learn in links).

                -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. Book: "The Checklist Manifesto"**
   - Read: Ch. 7 The Test
     - Key takeout(s):
     - The checklist must be used out in the field, with a controlled user group and fully monitored. Albeit this was for a surgical checklist, but even if doing it for a software project, would need some form of governance and monitoring in place.

   - Read: Ch. 6 The Checklist Factory
     - Key takeout(s):
     - Aircraft industry - electronic/hefty volumes of checklists
     - Updates send out aircraft manufacturers
     - Good checklists are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything - a checklist cannot fly a plane. Instead they provide a reminders of only the most critical and important steps - the ones that even the highest skilled professionals using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all practical.

  - Going through the lifecycle of a component, which consists of three main phases:-
  
    - Mounting: done first
      - constructor()
      - render()
      - componentDidMount()
    - Updating: we can put in `shouldComponentUpdate()` with a ternary operator, so as to render or not.
      - render()
      - componentDidUpdate()
    - Unmounting: when done, component is forgotten about by DOM.
      - componentWillUnmount()
