**2. Course: "The complete react developer in 2021"**
  - Going through the lifecycle of a component, which consists of three main phases:-
    - Mounting: done first
    - Updating: we can put in `shouldComponentUpdate()` with a ternary operator, so as to render or not. 
    - Unmounting: when done, component is forgotten about by DOM.

**3. Book: "The Checklist Manifesto"**
   - Read: Ch.2 The Checklist & Ch.3 The end of the Master Builder
     - Key takeout(s):
     - Checklist should be simple, brief and to the point. Checklists establish a higher standard of baseline performance.
     - Complex problems cannot be solved by one person, group ownership, responsibility and visible accountability is the key.

    - Decide on Components
    - Decide the State and where it lives
    - What changes when state changes

  Built a simple app that displays inform on cards from a third party api, and which we can perform a simple search on.

   - Read: Intro & Ch.1 The problem of extreme complexity 
     - Key takeout(s):
     - 'one needs to practice to achieve mastery, a body of experience before one achieves real success.'
